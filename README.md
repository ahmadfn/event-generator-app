# Event Generate Data Program
This is the program to generate event data for Data Engineer's DQLab Data Champion.

## Requirement

Python 3 is required to run this program. Any version of Python 3 should be fine. However, since this program is developed using Python 3.7.6, it was only tested in that version.

If you do not have Python 3 already, please refer to [Python official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download one.

## Instruction
1. Extract the program in any desired directory.
2. Run the program by entering the command `python generate-event-data.py`
3. The program will asks three arguments: order numbers, batch size, and output-dir. Please fill in all the arguments accordingly.
4. All files will be generated inside the directory that you have specified as output-dir argument.
5. Navigate to that directory. All the generated files should be there.

## Reason to use Python
The main reason to use Python is because the language itself is very easy to use. Developing program is much easier and the source code can be easily understood.

## Comment About Challenge
This challenge is quite challenging, especially since it has been a while to me to do a task like this. I have to re-write the code multiple times and to think thoroughly for the solution. However, i am quite confused about the relation of this challenge with description of being a data engineer. There should be an explanation on how this challenge can relate to the profession itself.
